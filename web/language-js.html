<h1 class="title">Javascript</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">
  JavaScript (JS) is a <code>lightweight</code>, <code>interpreted</code>, programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many <code>non-browser environments</code> also use it, such as node.js and Apache CouchDB. JS is a <code>prototype-based</code>, <code>multi-paradigm</code>, <code>dynamic</code> scripting language, supporting <code>object-oriented</code>, <code>imperative</code>, and <code>declarative</code> (e.g. functional programming) styles.

  <p>
    JavaScript is a <code>cross-platform</code>, <code>object-oriented</code> scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
  </p>
  <p>
    The JavaScript documentation on MDN includes the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">Learning the Web</a> provides information for beginners and introduces basic concepts of programming and the Internet.</li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide">JavaScript Guide</a> (this guide) provides an overview about the JavaScript language and its objects.</li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference">JavaScript Reference</a> provides detailed reference material for JavaScript.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as <code>Array</code>, <code>Date</code>, and <code>Math</code>, and a core set of language elements such as <code>operators</code>, <code>control structures</code>, and <code>statements</code>. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>Client-side</code> JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (<code>DOM</code>). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>Server-side</code> JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file <code>manipulations</code> on a server.
    </li>
  </ul>

    How do <code>HTML</code> and CSS work together? In general, you use <code>HTML</code> to describe the content of the document, not its style. You use CSS to specify the document's style, not its content. Later in this tutorial, you will see some exceptions to this arrangement.

    <div class="message-body">
      A markup language like HTML also provides some ways to specify style.
      For example, in HTML you can use a &lt;b&gt; tag to make text bold, and you can specify the background color of a page in its &lt;body&gt; tag.
      When you use CSS, you normally avoid using these features of the markup language so that all your document's style information is in one place.

  <h1 class="title">What is JavaScript, really?</h1>
  <p>
    JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a <code>full-fledged</code> dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide <code>dynamic interactivity</code> on websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScript is incredibly versatile. You can start small, with carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, and responses to button clicks. With more experience you'll be able to create games, animated <code>2D</code> and <code>3D</code> graphics, comprehensive <code>database-driven</code> apps, and much more!
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very <code>flexible</code>. Developers have written a large variety of tools complementing the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
    <li>Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate <code>functionality</code> in their sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
    <p>Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to <code>rapidly</code> build up sites and applications.</p>
  </ul>
