    <code>HTML</code> adds "markup" to standard English text. <code>Hyper Text</code> refers to links that connect
    Web pages to one another, making the <code>World Wide Web</code> what it is today. By creating and uploading Web
    pages to the <code>Internet</code>, you become an active participant in the <code>World Wide Web</code> once
    your site is online. HTML supports visual images and other media as well. With the help of HTML everyone can
    make static as well as <code>dynamic web sites</code>. HTML is the language that describes the structure and the
    semantic content of a <code>web document</code>. Content within a web page is tagged with HTML elements such as
    head, title, body, article, and so forth.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>html</code>: All markup language was contained in html tag.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>head</code>: Page information was contained in head tag.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>title</code>: For example, title for this page.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>body</code>: Page content should be contained in body tag.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <code>HTML</code> is the language that describes the structure and the semantic content of a Web document; it
    consists of <code>elements</code>, each of which may be modified by some number of <code>attributes</code>.

  The paragraph element consists of the start tag "&lt;p&gt;" and the closing tag "&lt;/p&gt;". The following example shows a paragraph contained within the HTML paragraph element. Remember that your browser will not display more than one space character in a row.

<h1 class="title">Tags</h1>
<p>
  <code>HTML</code> documents are written in plain text. You can write HTML in any text editor that lets you save content as plain text (e.g. Notepad, Notepad++, or Sublime Text),  but most HTML authors prefer to use a specialized editor that <code>highlights syntax</code> and shows the <code>DOM</code>. You may use uppercase for tag names, but the W3C (the global consortium that maintains the HTML standard) recommends using lower case (and <code>XHTML</code> requires lower case).
  HTML attaches special meaning to anything that starts with the <code>less-than</code> sign ("<") and ends with the <code>greater-than</code> sign (">"). Such markup is called a tag. Make sure to close the tag, as some tags are closed by default, whereas others might produce unexpected errors if you forget the end tag.
</p>

<hr>
<h1 class="title">Attributes</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    The start tag may contain <code>additional information</code>, as in the preceding example. Such information is called an attribute. <code>Attributes</code> usually consist of 2 parts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>An attribute <strong>name</strong></li>
    <li>An attribute <strong>value</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A few attributes can only have one value. They are <code>Boolean</code> attributes and may be shortened by only specifying the attribute name or leaving the attribute value empty. Thus, the following 3 examples have the same meaning:
  </p>

<h1 class="title">Named character references</h1>
<p>
  <code>Named character references</code> (often casually called entities) are used to print characters that have a special meaning in <code>HTML</code>. For example, HTML interprets the less-than and greater-than symbols as <code>tag delimiters</code>. When you want to display a greater-than symbol in the text, you can use a named character reference. You should know these four common named character references:
</p>
<div class="content">
  <ul>
    <li>&gt; denotes the greater-than sign (>)</li>
    <li>&lt; denotes the less-than sign (<)</li>
    <li>&amp; denotes the ampersand (&)</li>
    <li>&quot; denotes double quote (")</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>
  There are many <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#named-character-references">more entities</a>, but these four are the most important because they represent characters that have a special meaning in HTML.

<h1 class="title">Comments and doctype</h1>
<p>
  HTML has a <code>mechanism for embedding comments</code> that are not displayed when the page is rendered in a browser. This is useful for explaining a section of markup, leaving notes for other people who might work on the page, or for leaving reminders for yourself. HTML comments are enclosed in symbols as follows:
</p>
<div class="content">
  <ul>
    <li><code>&lt!-- This is comment text --&gt</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</code></li>
  </ul>
</div>
